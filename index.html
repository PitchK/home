                <p class = 'section'>A brief introduction...</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Let's start with an example. </p>
                <p class = 'content' id = 'story'>You just finished your fourth period class, and you are ready to get some lunch. You enter the restroom to wash your hands, and to your disbelief, you find a couple of your friends hanging out in there, with plastic sticks in their mouth. The air is cloudy with mist from these 'sticks'.
                <br><br>
                'What are you guys doing?' you ask.
                <br><br>
                One of your friends takes the stick out of his mouth. You notice something seems off about him. "Well, my brother just came home from college, he gave some to me. 'Try these', he told me. 'They feel great.' I'm curious so we're vaping them right now. Want to try one with us?" <!--state that they are shared-->
                <br><br>
                You are a little hesitant, so you politely decline.
                <br><br>
                'Come on!' another of your friends insist. 'My brother told us that these e-cigarettes are safer than normal cigarettes! It's a great way for us to look cool and hook up on the latest trend. It's perfectly legal as well! Everyone else is doing it around school too.'
                <br><br>
                You remember the anti-vape ads you always see while watching YouTube. You recall that they are as dangerous as normal cigarettes, as they contain formaldehyde and other metals that may cause cancer.  Again, you don't feel comfortable, so you say 'Sorry, I've got to go eat my lunch.'
                <br><br>
                Your friends don't like this. They shout threats at you as you leave the bathroom. A couple of them tease that they won't be your friend if you don't vape with them...
                </p>
                <p class = 'content'>This is just one example of an ongoing epidemic of substance use among adolescents. Not only vapes, but also other substances, such as alcohol and marijuana, are used . <b>Written by an adolescent, this website intends to raise awareness about substance use in adolescents, which is currently a serious topic.</b></p>

                <p class = 'section'>What exactly is substance use?</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Substance use, also known as SUD's, or sometimes called "drug addiction", is a behavioral condition where an individual uses a particular substance uncontrollably, despite having harmful consequences. These substances can range from everyday things like alcohol and tobacco, to illicit drugs such as methamphetamine and heroin. Oftentimes, these individuals are aware that what they are doing to their body is destructive, but they can't stop using these substances (We'll cover more why <a href="#okwhatdidthislinkleadmeto" class = 'links'>here</a>.) <!--why?-->Usually, their quality of life gets affected in a negative way, as well.<br><br>Here are a couple of extreme hypothetical examples of people with substance use disorders: 
                    <div id = 'liContainers'>
                        <li class = 'list'>Andrew is a high school junior who vapes. He is in a critical moment of college planning, but he uses all of his free time vaping with his friends. When he is in class, he cannot concentrate on what is being taught, and his mind is always on vaping. One day, when his parents found his vaping tools and took them away, he became violent.</li><br>
                        <li class = 'list'>James is in 12th grade. He illegally smokes marijuana with his friends everday, after school. He usually comes home high, and does nothing around the house. All he cares about during the day is marijuana, causing him to not pay attention in class. He doesn't do his homework either, potentially preventing him from entering college due to failing classes.</li><br>
                        
                    </div>
                    <!--extreme example first, but then use a more mellow example; i.e. one is irritated when he isnt vaping.-->
                <p class = 'content'>What you just read were extreme examples. 'Normal' or 'minor' cases of substance use may be more common than you think.</p>
