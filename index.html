                <p class = 'content'>Let's start with an example. </p>
                <p id = 'story'>You just finished your fourth period class, and you are ready to get some lunch. You enter the restroom to wash your hands, and to your disbelief, you find a couple of your friends hanging out in there, with plastic sticks in their mouth. The air is cloudy with mist from these 'sticks'.
                <br><br>
                'What are you guys doing?' you ask.
                <br><br>
                One of your friends takes the stick out of his mouth. You notice something seems off about him. "Well, my brother just came home from college, he gave some to me. 'Try these', he told me. 'They feel great.' I'm curious so we're vaping them right now. Want to try one with us?" <!--state that they are shared-->
                <br><br>
                You are a little hesitant, so you politely decline.
                <br><br>
                'Come on!' another of your friends insist. 'My brother told us that these e-cigarettes are safer than normal cigarettes! It's a great way for us to look cool and hook up on the latest trend. It's perfectly legal as well! Everyone else is doing it around school too.'
                <br><br>
                You remember the anti-vape ads you always see while watching YouTube. You recall that they are as dangerous as normal cigarettes, as they contain formaldehyde and other metals that may cause cancer.  Again, you don't feel comfortable, so you say 'Sorry, I've got to go eat my lunch.'
                <br><br>
                Your friends don't like this. They shout threats at you as you leave the bathroom. A couple of them tease that they won't be your friend if you don't vape with them...
                </p>
                <p class = 'content'>This is just one example of an ongoing epidemic of substance use among adolescents. Not only vapes, but also other substances, such as alcohol and marijuana, are used . <b>Written by an adolescent, this website intends to raise awareness about substance use in adolescents, which is currently a serious topic.</b></p>

                <p class = 'section'>What exactly is substance use, and how does it work?</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Substance use, also known as SUD's, or sometimes called "drug addiction", is a behavioral condition where an individual uses a particular substance uncontrollably, despite having harmful consequences. These substances can range from everyday things like alcohol and tobacco, to illicit drugs such as methamphetamine and heroin. Oftentimes, these individuals are aware that what they are doing to their body is destructive, but they can't stop using these substances (We'll cover more why <a href="#okwhatdidthislinkleadmeto" class = 'links'>here</a>.) <!--why?-->Usually, their quality of life gets affected in a negative way, as well.<sup>[1][2]</sup><br>

                <p class = 'imgCaption'>Usually, people who struggle with substance use struggle to quit, despite knowing that it is harmful.</p>
            
                <p class = 'content'>So, how does substance use work? The New England Journal of Medicine has divided substance use into 3 stages: <b>intoxication</b>, <b>withdrawal</b>, and <b>anticipation.</b><sup>[19]</sup> <br><br> <b>Intoxication. </b> Many substances, when consumed or injected, elicit a pleasurable effect. The dopamine (a hormone that is associated with pleasure) levels are increased in your brain, making you feel excellent! For example, heroin users report that they feel warm, safe, calm, and in a floating, dream-like state.<sup>[15]</sup>Cocaine users also state that they feel euphoric, extremely confident, and sociable. <sup>[18]</sup> This is a phenomenon known as getting 'high.' <br><br> <b>Withdrawal and negative effect.</b> This is where things get kind of ugly. After this initial high wears off, the individual enters a dysphoric state, where individuals may feel irritated, depressed, or other negative thoughts. This dysphoric state is fueled by stress related hormones, such as corticotropin-releasing-factor (CRF; more on that <a href="#hithere">here</a>), making the individual experience heightened sensitivity to stress. <br><br> <b>Anticipation. </b>In order to get relief from this terrible dysphoric state, the individual may start to crave the substance again, because he remembers how great it felt the first time he tried it.

                <hr>
                 <p class = 'content'>A couple of examples of people struggling with substance use is as follows: </p><br>
                    <div id = 'liContainers'>
                        <li class = 'list'>Andrew is a high school junior who vapes. He is in a critical moment of college planning, but he uses all of his free time vaping with his friends. When he is in class, he cannot concentrate on what is being taught, and his mind is always on vaping. One day, when his parents found his vaping tools and took them away, he became violent.</li><br>
                        <li class = 'list'>James is in 12th grade. He illegally smokes marijuana with his friends everday, after school. He usually comes home high, and does nothing around the house. All he cares about during the day is marijuana, causing him to not pay attention in class. He doesn't do his homework either, potentially preventing him from entering college due to failing classes.</li><br>
                        
                    </div>
                    <!--extreme example first, but then use a more mellow example; i.e. one is irritated when he isnt vaping.-->
                <p class = 'content'>What you just read were extreme examples. 'Normal' or 'minor' cases of substance use may be more common than you think.</p><br>
                    <li class = 'list'>Alex is another high schooler who vapes at school. Unlike Andrew, he is able to pay attention in class for the most part, but sort of gets irritated at home because he doesn't have access to vapes. He gets frusturated at small things when he is craving them.</li><br>
                    <li class = 'list'>James is a senior in high school about to graduate. On several occasions, his dad asked him for help on some chores, when James was smoking. James would get irritated at his dad calling him for help, and couldn't put the cigarette down to help his dad.</li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p class = 'section'>How does one fall into substance use?</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Let's start with the one of the biggest reasons - <b>peer pressure</b>.<sup>[16]</sup> The story at the beginning of this page is an example of almost falling for peer pressure. In most cases, friends or people around you may convince you to try a substance for particular reason, often threatening you if you don't. In the story, your friends told you multiple times to vape with them, and when you refused and walked out, some of them teased that they wont be your friend. Common phrases used by people who want you to try some substances may include: </p><br>
                <div>
                    <li class = 'list'>"You're not cool unless you do this with us!"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"What are you, a chicken?"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"Everyone else is doing it too!"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"We won't let you into our friend group unless you do this with us."</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"So and so said that this is safe!"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"C'mon man! Just one time. It shouldn't harm you right?"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"Don't you have an important exam to study for? Take this and you'll be fine!"</li>
                </div>
                <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5935229/pexels-photo-5935229.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500" class = 'contentImages' alt="peer pressure">
                <p class = 'imgCaption'>One may be tempted to fall into substance use when other people around them are doing it.</p>
                <p class = 'content'><b>Curiosity or boredom</b> may play a role in falling into substance use as well.<sup>[17]</sup> Let's say that there is a movie that came out. Everyone around you is talking about it, saying how good the movie is. You will perhaps get curious about what the movie is like, or what it is about, and therefore will want to watch it. The same thing can go with substances. Even if people around you aren't directly convincing you to try the substance, <b>if they keep telling you how great using the substance feels, you may be curious and be tempted to try the substance on your own to see what it is like.</b></p>
                <p class = 'content'>I'm pretty sure that there were days that you were literally bored to death, and anything would stimulate you. You would probably want to try something different, and therefore you may turn to substances. We will talk more about substance use and boredom <a href="#okwhatdidthisleadmeto" class = 'links'>here</a>.</p>
                <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2014/02/23/09/16/man-272675_1280.jpg" alt="boredom" class = 'contentImages'>
                <p class = 'imgCaption'>People with boredom may have a risk of falling into substance use, especially if they want to try something new.</p>
                <p class = 'content'> Another reason why one may fall into substance use is because they want to either <b>1) feel better </b>or <b>2) to get out of feeling depressed</b>. Let me ask you directly - what do you do when you are feeling down? Do you listen to music? Play video games? Go for a walk? While all of these options seem pretty normal, unfortunately this is not the case with some people. People may turn to substances when they are feeling down because they know that substances elicit a temporary feeling of euphoria.</p>
                <p class = 'content'><b>Let's talk role models.</b> All of us have definitely had a role model from time to time, whether it is our parents, a teacher, an older brother, or a close friend. When you have a role model, you are most likely to pay attention to their actions and will probably want to copy them to look 'cool'. This means that if someone you look up to uses a substance, you may most likely want to imitate whatever they are doing. This ties in with the previous point as well; if someone you look up to uses a substance just to get out of feeling 'down,' you may want to do so as well.</p>
                <p class = 'content'><b>The environment. </b>One may turn to substances if the environment around them is harsh; perhaps one's parents keep fighting, or just recently divorced. To escape the pain, turning to substances may be the only option that one canthink of. People may also use substances to rebel against their parents, because of the suffering that he or she went through because of them. <sup>[20]</sup></p><hr>
                <p class = 'content'>In summary, there are many factors that can lead to substance use, and they include peer pressure, curiosity, boredom, to feel better, or when someone you look up to uses a substance.</p>

                <p class = 'content'>There are many things that make substance use so harmful, but in this article we will focus on two things: <b>1) The effect that particular substance could have on your body,</b> and <b>2) the vicious cycle of substance use.</b><br><br>Some substances can cause a lot of harm to your body, whether it is short term or long term use. Several popular substances and their effects on the body are listed below.</p><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'>Marijuana</b> is one of the more popular substances that are used by adolescents. A recent study by New Zealand showed that heavy marijuana use during the teenage years caused people to lose an average of 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38. For context, an individual with 100 IQ is in the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of people have an IQ lower than 100. However, a loss of just 8 IQ points, resulting in an IQ of 92 in this case, places this individual in the 29th percentile. <sup>[3][4]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'>Vaping</b> is another popular substances, with one in 9 high school seniors using it daily. An FDA study analyzing samples of vapes from two leading brands showed that there are carcinogens (substances that cause cancer) inside of them. Vaping is also a way to inhale nicotine, which is more addictive then heroin and cocaine. Nicotine can also narrow your arteries, meaning blood flow is limited, and eventually may lead to heart attack and death. <sup>[5]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</b> is the 10th most popular drug worldwide, and is perfectly legal.<sup>[6]</sup> Usage of nitrous oxide is prevalent in parties, and is usually inhaled from balloons. Nitrous oxide inactivates vitamin B12 <sup>[7]</sup>, which is eventually excreted by the body <sup>[8]</sup>. This causes vitamin B12 deficiency, causing tingling and numbness in extremeties, and individuals may have trouble walking and balancing. Nitrous oxide can be fatal because it may cause hypoxia, where all your oxygen in your body slowly gets replaced with carbon dioxide, resulting in death.<sup>[citationaboutfatalhypoxiahere]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'>MDMA (ecstasy or Molly)</b> is a substance that has properties of stimulants (substances that 'wake you up') and hallucinogens (substances that make you see, hear, or feel things that don't exist) properties. It is popular among nightclubs, and affects the activity of norepinephrine, causing high heartrate and blood pressure. High doses also affect the body's mechanisms to regulate temperature, sometimes causing organ failure. <sup>[10]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> Common everyday items can be harmful as well. <b class = 'important'>Excessive alcohol drinking</b> has caused 95,000 deaths from 2011 to 2015, and can cause injuries, motor vehicle accidents, violence towards those who you live with, and much more <sup>[11]</sup>. It has other detrimental side effects as well, such as slurred speech, impaired coordination and memory, and even worse, heart or liver failure. <sup>[12]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b class = 'important'>Smoking</b> causes many problems and affects nearly every system of your body. When the ingredients in cigarettes burn, they produce over 7,000 chemicals, and out of those, 69 have been found to be associated with cancer.<sup>[13]</sup> Smoking also damages the tiny airways in the lungs, leading to lung disease.<sup>[14]</sup> Cigarettes contain nicotine, which narrow your blood vessels and increasing the risk of heart attack.<sup>[13]</sup> Because of all these complications it causes, it is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.<sup>[14]</sup></li><br>

                <p class = 'imgCaption'>Vaping is especially common among high schoolers. Vapes contain carcinogens, which are substances that may cause cancer in the future.</p>
                <p class = 'content'> <b>Let's talk about the danger of the repeated cycle of substance use, and also why it is so hard to quit.</b> When the brain is constantly exposed to the same reward over and over again (in this case the 'high' that the substance induces), dopamine stops firing in response to the reward, but instead starts firing when it detects something that may deliver the reward. For example, let's say you use marijuana with your friend all the time in the school bathrooms. When exposed to the 'high' of marijuana so many times, the dopamine in your brain may start firing when you 1) smell your friend's cologne, 2) see his house, or 3) pass by the school bathrooms. Because the brain 'predicts' that the reward will be delivered when dopamine fires, this can trigger a huge craving for a particular substance. <b>The constant exposure to these cravings is one of the reasons why substance use is so hard to quit.</b><br><br> When a substance is used repeatedly, it also renders the brain to be less 'rewarded' by stimuli that others would find rewarding. For example, in a normal brain, eating tasty food activates the brain's reward pathway, causing you to feel euphoric. However, in the brain of an individual who is struggling with substance use, eating tasty food does not make him feel as 'good.' This can be disasterous because the same thing happens with the substance that he is using. When an individual uses a substance for the first time, he achieves a certain level of euphoria. However, as he constantly repeats his use, the level of euphoria he achieves starts to come down, and <b>more of the substance is needed to get the initial amount of euphoria he achieved on his first hit.</b> <br><br><b>The connection with the dysphoric state.</b> The dysphoric state feels horrible, as we mentioned above. Individuals are more sensitive to stress, and they feel irritable. Therefore, individuals may use this substance to get himself out of the dysphoric state. <b>The indvidual now uses the substance to merely get himself out of this state because it feels so bad, and that is another reason why substance use is so hard to quit.</b> Remember, keep in mind that the individual is perhaps desparate to get out of this dysphoric state. If the individual cannot get his hands upon the substance for some reason, they may get violent and affect other people around them. <b>Therefore, substance use is not only harmful to the individual's own body, but it is also harmful to people around him.</b><br><br>Talk about memory storage, hippocampus, and so on, regarding how the drug's memory is stored.</p>

                <p class = 'content'>Wow, that was a lot! In case if that was too much, a summary of the what was covered is as follows:</p><br>
                <li>Constant exposure ot the 'high' can induce cravings.</li>
                <li>The danger of substance use is that repeated exposure to the reward, the level of euphoria he achieves starts to come down, and therefore he needs more substance to be achieve the same level of euphoria.</li>
                <li>Individuals are desparate to escape the dysphoric state, so they may start using the substance to get out of the dysphoric state. When he cannot get his hands on the substance, he may get violent and affect those around him.</li>

                <p class = 'content'>First of all, lets look at the prevalence of use of substances among adolescents. Prevalence of use within a certain time period means the probability that an individual has used a particular substance within that time period. For example, if substance X has a prevalence of use of 10% in the past year, this means that 10% of people have used substance X in the past year.</p>
