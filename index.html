                <p class = 'section'>A brief introduction...</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Let's start with an example. </p>
                <p class = 'content' id = 'story'>You just finished your fourth period class, and you are ready to get some lunch. You enter the restroom to wash your hands, and to your disbelief, you find a couple of your friends hanging out in there, with plastic sticks in their mouth. The air is cloudy with mist from these 'sticks'.
                <br><br>
                'What are you guys doing?' you ask.
                <br><br>
                One of your friends takes the stick out of his mouth. You notice something seems off about him. "Well, my brother just came home from college, he gave some to me. 'Try these', he told me. 'They feel great.' I'm curious so we're vaping them right now. Want to try one with us?" <!--state that they are shared-->
                <br><br>
                You are a little hesitant, so you politely decline.
                <br><br>
                'Come on!' another of your friends insist. 'My brother told us that these e-cigarettes are safer than normal cigarettes! It's a great way for us to look cool and hook up on the latest trend. It's perfectly legal as well! Everyone else is doing it around school too.'
                <br><br>
                You remember the anti-vape ads you always see while watching YouTube. You recall that they are as dangerous as normal cigarettes, as they contain formaldehyde and other metals that may cause cancer.  Again, you don't feel comfortable, so you say 'Sorry, I've got to go eat my lunch.'
                <br><br>
                Your friends don't like this. They shout threats at you as you leave the bathroom. A couple of them tease that they won't be your friend if you don't vape with them...
                </p>
                <p class = 'content'>This is just one example of an ongoing epidemic of substance use among adolescents. Not only vapes, but also other substances, such as alcohol and marijuana, are used . <b>Written by an adolescent, this website intends to raise awareness about substance use in adolescents, which is currently a serious topic.</b></p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p class = 'section'>What exactly is substance use?</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Substance use, also known as SUD's, or sometimes called "drug addiction", is a behavioral condition where an individual uses a particular substance uncontrollably, despite having harmful consequences. These substances can range from everyday things like alcohol and tobacco, to illicit drugs such as methamphetamine and heroin. Oftentimes, these individuals are aware that what they are doing to their body is destructive, but they can't stop using these substances (We'll cover more why <a href="#okwhatdidthislinkleadmeto" class = 'links'>here</a>.) <!--why?-->Usually, their quality of life gets affected in a negative way, as well <sup>[1][2]</sup>.<br><br>Here are a couple of extreme hypothetical examples of people with substance use disorders: 
                    <div id = 'liContainers'>
                        <li class = 'list'>Andrew is a high school junior who vapes. He is in a critical moment of college planning, but he uses all of his free time vaping with his friends. When he is in class, he cannot concentrate on what is being taught, and his mind is always on vaping. One day, when his parents found his vaping tools and took them away, he became violent.</li><br>
                        <li class = 'list'>James is in 12th grade. He illegally smokes marijuana with his friends everday, after school. He usually comes home high, and does nothing around the house. All he cares about during the day is marijuana, causing him to not pay attention in class. He doesn't do his homework either, potentially preventing him from entering college due to failing classes.</li><br>
                        
                    </div>
                    <!--extreme example first, but then use a more mellow example; i.e. one is irritated when he isnt vaping.-->
                <p class = 'content'>What you just read were extreme examples. 'Normal' or 'minor' cases of substance use may be more common than you think.</p>
                    <li class = 'list'>Alex is another high schooler who vapes at school. Unlike Andrew, he is able to pay attention in class for the most part, but sort of gets irritated at home because he doesn't have access to vapes. He gets frusturated at small things when he is craving them.</li><br>
                    <li class = 'list'>James is a senior in high school about to graduate. On several occasions, his dad asked him for help on some chores, when James was smoking. James would get irritated at his dad calling him for help, and couldn't put the cigarette down to help his dad.</li>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p class = 'section'>How does one fall into substance use?</p>
                <p class = 'content'>Let's start with the one of the biggest reasons - <b>peer pressure.</b> The story at the beginning of this page is an example of almost falling for peer pressure. In most cases, friends or people around you may convince you to try a substance for particular reason, often threatening you if you don't. In the story, your friends told you multiple times to vape with them, and when you refused and walked out, some of them teased that they wont be your friend. Common phrases used by people who want you to try some substances may include: </p>
                <div>
                    <li class = 'list'>"You're not cool unless you do this with us!"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"What are you, a chicken?"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"Everyone else is doing it too!"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"We won't let you into our friend group unless you do this with us."</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"So and so said that this is safe!"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"C'mon man! Just one time. It shouldn't harm you right?"</li>
                    <li class = 'list'>"Don't you have an important exam to study for? Take this and you'll be fine!"</li>
                </div>
                <p class = 'content'>Let's be honest here, most of us have a role model that we look up to. Whether it is parents, a particular celebrity, a teacher, or a movie superhero, we get inspired by the things that they do. When we were young, we definitely have had moments where we copied our favorite superhero's actions. The same thing can be said with substances. Let's say your favorite teacher invited you to a meal at a fancy restaurant. He takes some pills out and eats them in front of you, and you notice he is more talkative and friendly. You like his change in behavior, and while the teacher isn't looking you slip some of those pills into your mouth to get the same effect. <b>Therefore, one can fall into substance use if their role model, or someone they look up to, uses a substance.</b></p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div>
                <p class = 'section'>Why is substance use so harmful?</p>
                <p class = 'content'>There are many things that make substance use so harmful, but in this article we will focus on two things: <b>1) The effect that particular substance could have on your body,</b> and <b>2) the vicious cycle of substance use.</b><br><br>Some substances can cause a lot of harm to your body, whether it is short term or long term use. Several popular substances and their effects on the body are listed below.</p><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b>Marijuana</b> is one of the more popular substances that are used by adolescents. A recent study by New Zealand showed that heavy marijuana use during the teenage years caused people to lose an average of 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38. For context, an individual with 100 IQ is in the 50th percentile, meaning that 50% of people have an IQ lower than 100. However, a loss of just 8 IQ points, resulting in an IQ of 92 in this case, places this individual in the 29th percentile. <sup>[3][4]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b>Vaping</b> is another popular substances, with one in 9 high school seniors using it daily. An FDA study analyzing samples of vapes from two leading brands showed that there are carcinogens (substances that cause cancer) inside of them. Vaping is also a way to inhale nicotine, which is more addictive then heroin and cocaine. Nicotine can also narrow your arteries, meaning blood flow is limited, and eventually may lead to heart attack and death. <sup>[5]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b>Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)</b> is the 10th most popular drug worldwide, and is perfectly legal.<sup>[6]</sup> Usage of nitrous oxide is prevalent in parties, and is usually inhaled from balloons. Nitrous oxide inactivates vitamin B12 <sup>[7]</sup>, which is eventually excreted by the body <sup>[8]</sup>. This causes vitamin B12 deficiency, causing tingling and numbness in extremeties, and individuals may have trouble walking and balancing. Nitrous oxide can be fatal because it may cause hypoxia, where all your oxygen in your body slowly gets replaced with carbon dioxide, resulting in death.<sup>[citationaboutfatalhypoxiahere]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b>MDMA (ecstasy or Molly)</b> is a substance that has properties of stimulants (substances that 'wake you up') and hallucinogens (substances that make you see, hear, or feel things that don't exist) properties. It is popular among nightclubs, and affects the activity of norepinephrine, causing high heartrate and blood pressure. High doses also affect the body's mechanisms to regulate temperature, sometimes causing organ failure. <sup>[10]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> Common everyday items can be harmful as well. <b>Excessive alcohol drinking</b> has caused 95,000 deaths from 2011 to 2015, and can cause injuries, motor vehicle accidents, violence towards those who you live with, and much more <sup>[11]</sup>. It has other detrimental side effects as well, such as slurred speech, impaired coordination and memory, and even worse, heart or liver failure. <sup>[12]</sup></li><br>

                    <li class = 'list'> <b>Smoking</b> causes many problems and affects nearly every system of your body. When the ingredients in cigarettes burn, they produce over 7,000 chemicals, and out of those, 69 have been found to be associated with cancer.<sup>[13]</sup> Smoking also damages the tiny airways in the lungs, leading to lung disease.<sup>[14]</sup> Cigarettes contain nicotine, which narrow your blood vessels and increasing the risk of heart attack.<sup>[13]</sup> Because of all these complications it causes, it is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.<sup>[14]</sup></li><br>

                <p class = 'content'> <b>The vicious cycle of substance use is dangerous as well.</b> When a particular substance is used, such as alcohol or marijuana, dopamine (a hormone associated with pleasure) levels increase in the brain, leading to increased euphoria and pleasure. This is a phenomenon known as getting "high". For example, getting high on heroin makes the individual feel warm, safe, calm, and in a floating, dream-like state. <sup>[15]</sup> The unfortunate thing is, however, this effect does not last long - only for about a couple hours at the most. <sup>[citation?]</sup> After this, the second phase of substance use follows - which is the dysphoric state. </p>
