        <div>
            <p class = 'section'>A brief introduction...</p>
            <p class = 'content'>Let's start with an example. You just finished your fourth period class in high school, and you are ready to get to lunch. You enter the restroom to wash your hands, and to your disbelief, you find a couple of your friends hanging out in there, with plastic sticks in their mouth. The air is cloudy with mist from these 'sticks'.
            <br><br>
            'What are you guys doing?' you ask.
            <br><br>
            One of your friends takes the stick out of his mouth. You notice he is (insert condition here). 'Well, they just started to sell e-cigarettes at the 7-eleven down at the corner. We went there before school and purchased some, and we're trying them right now. Want to try one with us?'
            <br><br>
            You are a little hesitant, as you know what a cigarette is, but you've never heard of an e-cigarette. You politely decline.
            <br><br>
            'Come on!' another of your friends insist. 'These companies tell us that these e-cigarettes are safer than normal cigarettes! It's a great way for us to look cool and hook up on the latest trend. I'ts perfectly legal as well!'
            <br><br>
            Again, you don't feel comfortable, so you say 'Sorry, I've got to go eat my lunch.'
            <br><br>
            Your friends don't like this. They shout threats at you as you leave the bathroom. A couple of them state that they won't be your friend if you don't vape with them...

            <p class = 'section'>Well... before we start, what is a substance use disorder?</p>
